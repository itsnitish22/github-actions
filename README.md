# Getting Started with Github-actions

## Introduction to CI/CD

In early time when **Git** and **Github-actions** were not present, software engineers manually test their code and then depoly their project on production servers.

Later after if anything happens with the code like code broken or bug in the code then they have to face downtime with their website or app.

So that to get rid of this problem, CI/CD is introduced which means continous inegration and continous delivery. In CI/CD we create a pipline of autonomus tasks for our project like testing, deploying, etc.

There are various tools available in the market to create and deploy CI/CD piplines like Github actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.

## How to start with Github Actions

- Create a ".github" folder in your project folder.
- Create a "workflows" folder in that folder.
- Now if create any ".yml" file then it will be considered as a workflow.
